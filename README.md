# POLICE-STYLE-LED-FLASHER-PROTOTYPE
##INTRODUCTION  
•	This project is a police-style LED flasher built using the popular 555 Timer IC. 
•	The circuit uses two 555 timers (IC 555-2) arranged in simple astable mode to generate blinking signals. 
•	It operates from a 9V battery, making it suitable for: 
    o	Model vehicles 
    o	Emergency display units 
o	Electronics hobby demonstrations 
•	The flashing pattern is created by alternating a Red LED and a Blue LED, commonly used in police lights. 
•	The design focuses on: 
o	Minimal components 
o	Stable flashing 
o	Simple timing control using RC networks.
